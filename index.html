        <p >Thomas John Watson Sr. (February 17, 1874 â€“ June 19, 1956) 
            was an American businessman who served as the chairman and 
            CEO of (<a href="//www.ibm.com">IBM</a>). He oversaw the company's 
            growth into an international force from 1914 to 1956. Watson
            developed IBM's management style and corporate culture from 
            John Henry Patterson's training at NCR. He turned the company 
            into a highly effective selling organization, based largely 
            on punched card tabulating machines. A leading self-made 
            industrialist, he was one of the richest men of his time 
            and was called the world's greatest salesman when he died in 1956.
