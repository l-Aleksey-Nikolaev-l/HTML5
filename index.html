                    The first settlement on the territory of Budapest was built by Celts[19] before 1 AD. It was later occupied by the Romans.
                The Roman settlement – Aquincum – became the main city of Pannonia Inferior in 106 AD.[19] At first it was a military settlement, 
                and gradually the city rose around it, making it the focal point of the city's commercial life. Today this area corresponds to the 
                Óbuda district within Budapest.[63] The Romans constructed roads, amphitheaters, baths and houses with heated floors in this fortified 
                military camp.[64] The Roman city of Aquincum is the best-conserved of the Roman sites in Hungary. The archaeological site was turned 
                into a museum with indoor and open-air sections.[65] <br>
                    The Magyar tribes led by Árpád, forced out of their original homeland north of Bulgaria by Tsar Simeon after the Battle of Southern Buh, 
                settled in the territory at the end of the 9th century displacing the founding Bulgarian settlers of the towns of Buda and Pest,[21][66] 
                and a century later officially founded the Kingdom of Hungary.[21] Research places the probable residence of the Árpáds as an early place 
                of central power near what became Budapest.[67] The Tatar invasion in the 13th century quickly proved it is difficult to defend a plain.
                [16][21] King Béla IV of Hungary, therefore, ordered the construction of reinforced stone walls around the towns[21] and set his own royal 
                palace on the top of the protecting hills of Buda. In 1361 it became the capital of Hungary.[22][16] <br>
                    The cultural role of Buda was particularly significant during the reign of King Matthias Corvinus. The Italian Renaissance had a great 
                influence on the city. His library, the Bibliotheca Corviniana, was Europe's greatest collection of historical chronicles and philosophic 
                and scientific works in the 15th century, and second in size only to the Vatican Library.[16] After the foundation of the first Hungarian 
                university in Pécs in 1367 (University of Pécs), the second one was established in Óbuda in 1395 (University of Óbuda).[68] 
                The first Hungarian book was printed in Buda in 1473.[69] Buda had about 5,000 inhabitants around 1500.[70] <br>
                The Ottomans conquered Buda in 1526, as well in 1529, and finally occupied it in 1541.[71] The Turkish Rule lasted for more than 150 years.[16] 
                The Ottoman Turks constructed many prominent bathing facilities within the city.[21] Some of the baths that the Turks erected during their rule 
                are still in use 500 years later (Rudas Baths and Király Baths). By 1547 the number of Christians was down to about a thousand, and by 1647 it 
                had fallen to only about seventy.[70] The unoccupied western part of the country became part of the Habsburg monarchy as Royal Hungary.
                In 1686, two years after the unsuccessful siege of Buda, a renewed campaign was started to enter Buda. This time, the Holy League's army 
                was twice as large, containing over 74,000 men, including German, Croat, Dutch, Hungarian, English, Spanish, Czech, Italian, French, 
                Burgundian, Danish and Swedish soldiers, along with other Europeans as volunteers, artillerymen, and officers. The Christian forces seized Buda, 
                and in the next few years, all of the former Hungarian lands, except areas near Temesvár (Timișoara), were taken from the Turks. In the 1699 
                Treaty of Karlowitz, these territorial changes were officially recognized to show the end of the rule of the Turks, and in 1718 the entire 
                Kingdom of Hungary was removed from Ottoman rule. <br>
                    The 19th century was dominated by the Hungarian struggle for independence[16] and modernisation. The national insurrection against the 
                Habsburgs began in the Hungarian capital in 1848 and was defeated one and a half years later, with the help of the Russian Empire. 1867 
                was the year of Reconciliation that brought about the birth of Austria-Hungary. This made Budapest the twin capital of a dual monarchy. 
                It was this compromise which opened the second great phase of development in the history of Budapest, lasting until World War I. In 1849 
                the Chain Bridge linking Buda with Pest was opened as the first permanent bridge across the Danube[72] and in 1873 Buda and Pest were 
                officially merged with the third part, Óbuda (Old Buda), thus creating the new metropolis of Budapest. The dynamic Pest grew into the 
                country's administrative, political, economic, trade and cultural hub. Ethnic Hungarians overtook Germans in the second half of the 19th 
                century due to mass migration from the overpopulated rural Transdanubia and Great Hungarian Plain. Between 1851 and 1910 the proportion 
                of Hungarians increased from 35.6% to 85.9%, Hungarian became the dominant language, and German was crowded out. The proportion of Jews 
                peaked in 1900 with 23.6%.[73][74][75] Due to the prosperity and the large Jewish community of the city at the start of the 20th century, 
                Budapest was often called the "Jewish Mecca"[22] or "Judapest".[76][77] Budapest also became an important center for the Aromanian diaspora 
                during the 19th century.[78] In 1918, Austria-Hungary lost the war and collapsed; Hungary declared itself an independent republic 
                (Republic of Hungary). In 1920 the Treaty of Trianon partitioned the country, and as a result, Hungary lost over two-thirds of its territory, 
                and about two-thirds of its inhabitants, including 3.3 million out of 15 million ethnic Hungarians.[79][80]
